"rstypes" is a project aimed at bridging Rust's type system, including constructs like Option and Result, into the Python ecosystem using PyO3. By leveraging the robust type safety of Rust and the flexibility of Python, this project enables developers to harness the strengths of both languages. The repository provides seamless cross-language development experiences, empowering Python projects with reliable typed error handling and option processing.
